# Contributions
This repo is for community contributions to the DAD-CDM project. All information about this Open Project can be found in the [administrative repo](https://github.com/DAD-CDM/dad-cdm-admin/tree/main) and on the [official project portal](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/dad-cdm).

## How to contribute?

Please read the project's [contributions guidelines](https://github.com/DAD-CDM/dad-cdm-admin/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) first. For this repository, we ask for each contribution to be discussed in an issue first. Open an ['Issue'](https://github.com/DAD-CDM/Contributions/issues) to provide context for your contribution and enable open discussion about it. 

Your contribution should then be made using a 'Pull Request' linked to the 'Issue' representing the context. Place your files in a directory with a name that reflects the contribution made."
