## TA00: Murky Origins
 
It began as many awful things do these days—with a horrific minor news item from some previously uncharted geography. Kevin Campbell of Eustis, Ohio, stood accused of systematically depopulating the canine population of his hometown over a three-week long “feeding frenzy.”
 
Until recently, Campbell had been a stand-up member of his community. Just another lifelong Eustonian with a close-knit family and season tickets to the local AA baseball club.
 
Family and friends noticed a change in Campbell after an accident at the local superfund site where he had been employed as an excavator operator for the past six years rendered him temporarily unconscious. Kevin Campbell was a different man when he awoke in the hospital.
 
Speaking exclusively in the third person, Campbell demanded to be referred to henceforth as “BALTHOR the GREAT.” Upon his return to work, colleagues noticed a distinct lack of empathy in BALTHOR. He seemed to relish in the pain of others and began exhibiting a healthy appetite for raw meat that made him an instant lunchtime pariah.
 
Tipped off about his unceasing lust for flesh, the Eustis Police arrested Campbell after a weeks-long period in which the local populace was terrorized by nocturnal visions of a stooped man in tattered work clothes depopulated a town of its canine companions.

The saga of BALTHOR would have died on the vine had Eustis PD not blundered twice in the span of a day’s time.
 
First, after BALTHOR made bail and was released on his own dubious recognizance, the police chief gathered the local media for a perp walk. Unintimidated, BALTHOR offered a sneering forty-minute diatribe steeped in a brazen eschatological world view. BALTHOR, as it turned out, espoused a belief in a natural obligation to consume any life which he could subdue in order to elevate his powers to heights great enough to enable BALTHOR to subjugate the entire world and bring about the end of life as we knew it.
 
The accusations facing the former Kevin Campbell would have made a juicy evening news story in and of their own, but the addition of this deeply unsavory bit of oratory ensured that BALTHOR’s ideas would receive national attention.
 
Formal news coverage transformed into secondary and tertiary social media content in which aghast content-creators amplified the idea of a local lunatic turned mad prophet into a positive feedback loop of algorhythmic superpower.
 
Eventually the BALTHOR saga caught the attention of users at sepsis.zone, a cut-rate forum leveraging Namibian-operated servers to host crowd-sourced content for misanthropes who delighted in the offensive. After an anonymous user replied to the initial news item thread with the words “FREE BALTHOR,” a shadow movement supporting the Ohio-based demiurge began to spread across the less-traveled corners of the internet.
 
Around the time that “FREE BALTHOR” infiltrated content on more mainstream social media platforms, the second critical error committed by the Eustis Police Department became apparent. Though BALTHOR had readily confessed to his crimes, he had done so without having first been mirandized. BALTHOR was cleared on a technicality.
 
Freshly divorced, unemployed, and shunned in his community, BALTHOR had only two priorities—the consumption of flesh and aimless destruction. Others, however, singled out BALTHOR for a loftier role in local history.
 
Declan Bumpus, a political consultant for fringe movements, professional provocateur, and frequent sepsis.zone commenter, interpreted the sensation surrounding BALTHOR as both a sign of a mightier populism waiting to be harnessed and an opportunity to marshal power for himself.
 
TA01: Plan Strategy
 
If anyone at the Days Inn off the highway in Eustis, Ohio, had been a forensic accountant of any particular renown, they could have traced the credit card Declan Bumpus used for his week’s stay on its long, curving path of money laundering white water back to the state actors half a world away who were intent on destabilizing American democracy.
 
Whoever they were, they had invested wisely.
 
“What if I told you that I could make your wildest dreams come true if you just do exactly as I say,” Bumpus offered.
 
“Sure,” BALTHOR croaked, burping up some of the roadkill breakfast that had made him fifteen minutes late to the meeting.
 
Bumpus elucidated a grand plan: play on the logical inconsistencies between the cherished myths of the United States and the practical reality of life in the Land of the Free. Feed on the discontinuities and offer seemingly appealing alternatives that whitewashed moral repugnancy as patriotic duty. Start small and build big. Make an entire town question its foundations and refashion reality howsoever they pleased. Consolidate power and curry influence.
 
Together they settled on a mayoral bid.
 
“Small potatoes,” Declan Bumpus said. “It’s not about holding office. It’s about having influence.”
